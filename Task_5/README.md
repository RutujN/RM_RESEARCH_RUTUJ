I have used Jupyter Notebook to include both code snippets and screenshots within the notebook.

The original dataset file provided was "weatherAUS.csv".
 After cleaning the data, I saved the processed dataset as "weatherAUS_cleaned.csv". 
 Further optimizations, such as adding new functions and extracting date components, were applied, with all these changes saved in the final version named "weatherAUS_cleaned_final.csv".
